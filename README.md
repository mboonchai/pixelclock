This is LaMetric Clone for Raspberry PI 4, implemented with Flutter.
You will also need a led screen (preferred 4:1).
Follow instruction here to compile --> https://github.com/ardera/flutter-pi

This project also need custom version of spritewidget library to compile --> https://github.com/mboonchai/spritewidget/tree/fix_sprite_box

I'm currently rewrote this project with Flame Engine and will be open to public after I've cleaned up some codes.
